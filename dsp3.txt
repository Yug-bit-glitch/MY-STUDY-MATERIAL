x ∗ y = (e ∗ x) ∗ y           [by (3), left identity]
      = ((z ∗ y) ∗ x) ∗ y     [since z ∗ y = e]
      = (z ∗ (y ∗ x)) ∗ y     [by associativity]
      = (z ∗ e) ∗ y           [since y ∗ x = e]
      = z ∗ (e ∗ y)           [by associativity]
      = z ∗ y                 [by (3), left identity]
      = e                     [by definition of z]
```

So x ∗ y = e, proving right inverse.

**Step 2:** Prove right identity.

For any x ∈ G:
```
x ∗ e = x ∗ (y ∗ x)           [since y ∗ x = e]
      = (x ∗ y) ∗ x           [by associativity]
      = e ∗ x                 [since x ∗ y = e from Step 1]
      = x                     [by (3), left identity]
```

Therefore, G is a group. ∎

## **PROBLEM 2: Self-Inverse ⟹ Abelian**

**Given:** Every element of G is its own inverse, i.e., x ∗ x = e for all x ∈ G.

**To Prove:** G is abelian (a ∗ b = b ∗ a for all a, b ∈ G).

**Proof:**

Let a, b ∈ G. Consider the element a ∗ b.

Since every element is its own inverse:
```
(a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b) = e
```

Also, we know:
```
a ∗ a = e  and  b ∗ b = e
```

Now:
```
a ∗ b = e ∗ (a ∗ b) ∗ e                    [identity property]
      = (a ∗ a) ∗ (a ∗ b) ∗ (b ∗ b)        [since a∗a = e, b∗b = e]
      = a ∗ (a ∗ a ∗ b ∗ b) ∗ b            [associativity]
      = a ∗ ((a ∗ a) ∗ (b ∗ b)) ∗ b        [associativity]
      = a ∗ (e ∗ e) ∗ b                    [substituting]
      = a ∗ e ∗ b                          
      = a ∗ b
```

More directly:
```
(a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b) = e
```

Multiply both sides on left by a and on right by b:
```
a ∗ (a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b) ∗ b = a ∗ e ∗ b
a ∗ ((a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b)) ∗ b = a ∗ b
a ∗ e ∗ b = a ∗ b
```

Actually, let me use a cleaner approach:
```
a ∗ b = (a ∗ b)⁻¹              [since (a∗b)∗(a∗b) = e]
      = b⁻¹ ∗ a⁻¹              [inverse of product rule]
      = b ∗ a                  [since b⁻¹ = b and a⁻¹ = a]
```

Therefore, G is abelian. ∎

## **PROBLEM 3: No Proper Subgroups ⟹ Cyclic**

**Given:** G has no proper subgroups.

**To Prove:** G is cyclic.

**Proof:**

**Case 1:** If G = {e}, then G = ⟨e⟩ is cyclic (trivial group).

**Case 2:** If G has at least one non-identity element, let g ∈ G where g ≠ e.

Consider H = ⟨g⟩ = {gⁿ | n ∈ ℤ}, the cyclic subgroup generated by g.

We know:
- H is a subgroup of G
- e ∈ H (when n = 0)
- g ∈ H (when n = 1), so H ≠ {e}

Since G has no proper subgroups, and H is a subgroup with H ≠ {e}, we must have:
```
H = G
```

Therefore:
```
G = ⟨g⟩
```

So G is cyclic. ∎

## **PROBLEM 4: Left Cosets of {1, 11} in U(30)**

**First, find U(30):**

U(30) = {k : 1 ≤ k < 30, gcd(k, 30) = 1}

Since 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, we need numbers coprime to 30:

U(30) = {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}

|U(30)| = φ(30) = 30(1 - 1/2)(1 - 1/3)(1 - 1/5) = 8

**Let H = {1, 11}**

**Find all left cosets aH = {a·1, a·11} (mod 30):**

1. **1H** = {1·1, 1·11} = {1, 11}
2. **7H** = {7·1, 7·11} = {7, 77} = {7, 17} (mod 30)
3. **11H** = {11·1, 11·11} = {11, 121} = {11, 1} = {1, 11} = 1H
4. **13H** = {13·1, 13·11} = {13, 143} = {13, 23} (mod 30)
5. **17H** = {17·1, 17·11} = {17, 187} = {17, 7} = {7, 17} = 7H
6. **19H** = {19·1, 19·11} = {19, 209} = {19, 29} (mod 30)
7. **23H** = {23·1, 23·11} = {23, 253} = {23, 13} = {13, 23} = 13H
8. **29H** = {29·1, 29·11} = {29, 319} = {29, 19} = {19, 29} = 19H

**Distinct left cosets:**
1. {1, 11}
2. {7, 17}
3. {13, 23}
4. {19, 29}

These 4 cosets partition U(30). ∎

## **PROBLEM 5: gᵐ ∈ H and gcd(m,n)=1 ⟹ g ∈ H**

**Given:**
- H ⊆ G (H is a subgroup)
- |g| = n (order of g is n)
- gᵐ ∈ H
- gcd(m, n) = 1

**To Prove:** g ∈ H

**Proof:**

Since gcd(m, n) = 1, by Bézout's identity, there exist integers s, t such that:
```
sm + tn = 1
```

Rearranging:
```
sm = 1 - tn
```

Now consider:
```
g = g¹ = g^(sm + tn)
  = g^(sm) · g^(tn)
  = (g^m)^s · (g^n)^t
```

Since |g| = n, we have gⁿ = e. Therefore:
```
g = (g^m)^s · e^t
  = (g^m)^s
```

Since gᵐ ∈ H and H is a subgroup (closed under the group operation):
```
(g^m)^s ∈ H
```

Therefore:
```
g ∈ H
```

∎

## **PROBLEM 6: U(12) ≅ U(8)**

**Find U(12) and U(8):**

U(12) = {1, 5, 7, 11} (numbers coprime to 12)
U(8) = {1, 3, 5, 7} (numbers coprime to 8)

Both have order 4.

**Create multiplication tables:**

**U(12) mod 12:**
```
·  | 1  5  7  11
---|-------------
1  | 1  5  7  11
5  | 5  1  11 7
7  | 7  11 1  5
11 | 11 7  5  1
```

**U(8) mod 8:**
```
·  | 1  3  5  7
---|------------
1  | 1  3  5  7
3  | 3  1  7  5
5  | 5  7  1  3
7  | 7  5  3  1
```

Both are isomorphic to **ℤ₂ × ℤ₂** (Klein four-group).

**Define isomorphism φ: U(12) → U(8):**
```
φ(1) = 1
φ(5) = 3
φ(7) = 5
φ(11) = 7
```

**Verify it's a homomorphism (sample checks):**
- φ(5·7) = φ(11) = 7, and φ(5)·φ(7) = 3·5 = 15 ≡ 7 (mod 8) ✓
- φ(5·5) = φ(1) = 1, and φ(5)·φ(5) = 3·3 = 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8) ✓
- φ(7·11) = φ(5) = 5, and φ(7)·φ(11) = 5·7 = 35 ≡ 3 (mod 8)... 

Let me recalculate: 7·11 = 77 ≡ 5 (mod 12), φ(5) = 3
5·7 (in U(8)) = 35 ≡ 3 (mod 8) ✓

Therefore U(12) ≅ U(8). ∎

## **PROBLEM 7: Homomorphism x ↦ xʳ**

**Given:** φ: ℝ* → ℝ* defined by φ(x) = xʳ, where r is a positive integer.

**Part 1: Show φ is a homomorphism**

For all x, y ∈ ℝ*:
```
φ(x · y) = (xy)^r
         = x^r · y^r          [by exponent laws]
         = φ(x) · φ(y)
```

Therefore φ is a homomorphism. ✓

**Part 2: Determine the kernel**
```
ker(φ) = {x ∈ ℝ* | φ(x) = 1}
       = {x ∈ ℝ* | x^r = 1}
```

The solutions to xʳ = 1 in ℝ* are the **r-th roots of unity** in the reals:
- If r is odd: ker(φ) = {1}
- If r is even: ker(φ) = {1, -1}

**Part 3: When is φ an isomorphism?**

φ is an isomorphism if it's bijective.

**Injectivity:** φ is injective ⟺ ker(φ) = {1} ⟺ r is odd

**Surjectivity:** For any y ∈ ℝ*, we need x such that xʳ = y.
- If r is odd: Every real number has a unique r-th root, so φ is surjective.
- If r is even: Negative numbers don't have real r-th roots, so φ is not surjective (image is only positive reals).

**Answer:** φ is an isomorphism **if and only if r is odd**. ∎

## **PROBLEM 8: Basic Ring Properties**

Let R be a ring with additive identity 0.

**Part (a): a·0 = 0·a = 0 for all a ∈ R**
```
a·0 = a·(0 + 0)         [since 0 + 0 = 0]
    = a·0 + a·0         [distributivity]
```

Subtracting a·0 from both sides:
```
0 = a·0
```

Similarly:
```
0·a = (0 + 0)·a = 0·a + 0·a
```
Therefore 0·a = 0. ∎

**Part (b): a·(-b) = (-a)·b = -(a·b)**
```
a·b + a·(-b) = a·(b + (-b))    [distributivity]
             = a·0
             = 0                [by part (a)]
```

Therefore a·(-b) is the additive inverse of a·b, so a·(-b) = -(a·b).

Similarly:
```
a·b + (-a)·b = (a + (-a))·b = 0·b = 0
```

Therefore (-a)·b = -(a·b). ∎

**Part (c): (-a)·(-b) = a·b**
```
(-a)·(-b) = -(a·(-b))      [by part (b)]
          = -(-(a·b))       [by part (b) again]
          = a·b             [double negative]
```
∎

**Part (d): If R has unity 1, then (-1)·a = -a**
```
1·a + (-1)·a = (1 + (-1))·a    [distributivity]
             = 0·a
             = 0                [by part (a)]
```

Therefore (-1)·a = -a. ∎

**Part (e): If R has unity, then (-1)·(-1) = 1**
```
(-1)·(-1) = -(−1)       [by part (d) with a = -1]
          = 1           [inverse of -1]
```

Or using part (c) with a = b = 1:
```
(-1)·(-1) = 1·1 = 1
```
∎

## **PROBLEM 9: Every non-zero element of ℤₙ is a unit or zero-divisor**

**To Prove:** For any [a] ∈ ℤₙ with a ≠ 0, either [a] is a unit or [a] is a zero-divisor.

**Proof:**

Let [a] ∈ ℤₙ with 1 ≤ a ≤ n-1.

**Case 1:** gcd(a, n) = 1

Then there exist integers s, t such that as + nt = 1 (Bézout).

This means as ≡ 1 (mod n), so [a]·[s] = [1] in ℤₙ.

Therefore [a] is a **unit**.

**Case 2:** gcd(a, n) = d > 1

Let a = da' and n = dn' where gcd(a', n') may not be 1 but n' < n.

Then:
```
a · n' = da' · n' = a' · dn' = a' · n ≡ 0 (mod n)
```

So [a]·[n'] = [0] in ℤₙ, where 0 < n' < n.

Therefore [a] is a **zero-divisor**.

Since every non-zero element falls into exactly one of these cases, every non-zero element of ℤₙ is either a unit or a zero-divisor. ∎

## **PROBLEM 10: Nilpotent Elements**

**Given:**
- Ring R where xⁿ = x for all x ∈ R (some fixed n > 1)
- aᵐ = 0 for some positive integer m

**To Prove:** a = 0

**Proof:**

Since xⁿ = x for all x ∈ R, we have:
```
a = a^n
```

Now:
```
a^m = 0                  [given]
```

Consider a^(nm):
```
a^(nm) = (a^n)^m
       = a^m              [since a^n = a]
       = 0                [given]
```

But also:
```
a^(nm) = (a^m)^n
       = 0^n              [since a^m = 0]
       = 0
```

Now, we can repeatedly apply the property aⁿ = a:
```
a = a^n = a^(n²) = a^(n³) = ...
```

Since aᵐ = 0, consider a^(nm):
```
a^(nm) = 0
```

But we can write:
```
a = a^n = a^(n²) = ... = a^(n^k)
```

For sufficiently large k, we have n^k ≥ m.

Let n^k = qm + r where 0 ≤ r < m.

Then:
```
a = a^(n^k) = a^(qm + r) = (a^m)^q · a^r = 0^q · a^r = 0 · a^r = 0
```

Therefore a = 0. ∎

## **PROBLEM 11: ℤ is a Principal Ideal Domain**

**To Prove:** Every ideal I of ℤ is principal, i.e., I = ⟨a⟩ for some a ∈ ℤ.

**Proof:**

Let I be an ideal of ℤ.

**Case 1:** If I = {0}, then I = ⟨0⟩, which is principal.

**Case 2:** If I ≠ {0}, then I contains some non-zero elements.

Since I contains both a and -a (as an additive subgroup), I contains positive integers.

Let d = min{x ∈ I | x > 0} (the smallest positive element in I).

**Claim:** I = ⟨d⟩ = {nd | n ∈ ℤ}

**Proof of ⟨d⟩ ⊆ I:**
Since d ∈ I and I is an ideal, for any n ∈ ℤ:
```
nd ∈ I
```
Therefore ⟨d⟩ ⊆ I.

**Proof of I ⊆ ⟨d⟩:**
Let a ∈ I. By the division algorithm:
```
a = qd + r  where 0 ≤ r < d
```

Since a ∈ I and qd ∈ I (as shown above), we have:
```
r = a - qd ∈ I
```

But r < d and d was the smallest positive element in I.

Since r ≥ 0 and r < d, we must have r = 0.

Therefore a = qd ∈ ⟨d⟩.

Thus I ⊆ ⟨d⟩.

**Conclusion:** I = ⟨d⟩, so every ideal of ℤ is principal. Therefore ℤ is a PID. ∎

## **PROBLEM 12: Every Field is an Integral Domain**

**To Prove:** If F is a field, then F is an integral domain (i.e., F has no zero-divisors).

**Proof:**

Let F be a field. By definition, F is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

Suppose a, b ∈ F with a·b = 0.

**To show:** Either a = 0 or b = 0 (i.e., no zero-divisors exist).

Suppose a ≠ 0. Since F is a field, a has a multiplicative inverse a⁻¹.

Multiply both sides of a·b = 0 by a⁻¹:
```
a⁻¹·(a·b) = a⁻¹·0
(a⁻¹·a)·b = 0        [associativity]
1·b = 0              [since a⁻¹·a = 1]
b = 0
```

Therefore, if a·b = 0 and a ≠ 0, then b = 0.

This means F has no zero-divisors, so F is an integral domain. ∎

---

## **PROBLEM 13: Frobenius Endomorphism (Freshman's Dream)**

**Given:** F is a field of characteristic p ≠ 0 (where p is prime).

**Part (a): Prove (a + b)ᵖ = aᵖ + bᵖ**

**Proof:**

By the binomial theorem:
```
(a + b)^p = Σ(k=0 to p) C(p,k) a^(p-k) b^k
```

where C(p,k) = p!/(k!(p-k)!) is the binomial coefficient.

**Key observation:** For 0 < k < p:
```
C(p,k) = p!/(k!(p-k)!)
```

Since p is prime and 0 < k < p, the numerator p! contains p as a factor, but neither k! nor (p-k)! contains p as a factor.

Therefore p divides C(p,k) for 0 < k < p.

In a field of characteristic p, if p divides an integer n, then n ≡ 0 in F.

Therefore:
```
(a + b)^p = C(p,0)a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1)b + ... + C(p,p-1)ab^(p-1) + C(p,p)b^p
          = 1·a^p + 0 + ... + 0 + 1·b^p
          = a^p + b^p
```
∎

**Part (b): Prove (a + b)^(pⁿ) = a^(pⁿ) + b^(pⁿ)**

**Proof by induction on n:**

**Base case (n = 1):** Proven in part (a).

**Inductive step:** Assume (a + b)^(pᵏ) = a^(pᵏ) + b^(pᵏ) for some k ≥ 1.

We need to show (a + b)^(p^(k+1)) = a^(p^(k+1)) + b^(p^(k+1)).

Note that p^(k+1) = p·p^k.
```
(a + b)^(p^(k+1)) = (a + b)^(p·p^k)
                   = ((a + b)^(p^k))^p
                   = (a^(p^k) + b^(p^k))^p     [by inductive hypothesis]
                   = (a^(p^k))^p + (b^(p^k))^p [by part (a)]
                   = a^(p^(k+1)) + b^(p^(k+1))
