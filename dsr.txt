## Question 11: Prove that ℤ is a Principal Ideal Domain
**[5 marks]**

### Proof

We need to prove that every ideal of ℤ is a principal ideal, i.e., every ideal *I* of ℤ can be written as *I* = ⟨*a*⟩ = {*ad* | *d* ∈ ℤ} for some *a* ∈ ℤ.

**Step 1:** Let *I* be an ideal of ℤ.

**Step 2:** Consider two cases:

**Case I:** If *I* = {0}, then *I* = ⟨0⟩, which is a principal ideal generated by 0.

**Case II:** If *I* ≠ {0}, then *I* contains at least one non-zero element.

**Step 3:** Since *I* is an ideal, if *x* ∈ *I*, then -*x* ∈ *I*. Therefore, *I* must contain positive integers.

**Step 4:** By the Well-Ordering Principle, the set of all positive integers in *I* has a least element. Let *a* be the smallest positive integer in *I*.

**Step 5:** We claim that *I* = ⟨*a*⟩. We prove this by showing:
- (i) ⟨*a*⟩ ⊆ *I*
- (ii) *I* ⊆ ⟨*a*⟩

**Step 6:** Proof of ⟨*a*⟩ ⊆ *I*:

Since *a* ∈ *I* and *I* is an ideal, for any *k* ∈ ℤ, we have *ka* ∈ *I*.

Therefore, ⟨*a*⟩ = {*ka* | *k* ∈ ℤ} ⊆ *I*.

**Step 7:** Proof of *I* ⊆ ⟨*a*⟩:

Let *b* be any element in *I*. By the Division Algorithm, we can write:

```
b = qa + r    where q, r ∈ ℤ and 0 ≤ r < a
```

**Step 8:** Now, *r* = *b* - *qa*.

Since *b* ∈ *I* and *qa* ∈ *I* (as *a* ∈ *I* and *I* is an ideal), we have:

```
r = b - qa ∈ I
```

**Step 9:** We have *r* ∈ *I* and 0 ≤ *r* < *a*.

But *a* is the smallest positive integer in *I*.

Since *r* < *a*, we must have *r* = 0.

**Step 10:** Therefore, *b* = *qa* + 0 = *qa* ∈ ⟨*a*⟩.

Since *b* was arbitrary, *I* ⊆ ⟨*a*⟩.

**Step 11:** From Steps 6 and 10, we have *I* = ⟨*a*⟩.

**Conclusion:** Every ideal of ℤ is principal. Hence, ℤ is a Principal Ideal Domain.

**Hence proved.** ∎

## Question 12: Prove that a Field is an Integral Domain
**[5 marks]**

### Proof

Let *F* be a field. We need to prove that *F* is an integral domain.

**Recall:** An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors.

**Step 1:** Since *F* is a field, by definition:
- (i) *F* is a commutative ring
- (ii) *F* has a multiplicative identity (unity) 1 ≠ 0
- (iii) Every non-zero element of *F* has a multiplicative inverse

**Step 2:** We need to prove that *F* has no zero divisors.

That is, we must show: If *a*, *b* ∈ *F* and *ab* = 0, then either *a* = 0 or *b* = 0.

**Step 3:** Let *a*, *b* ∈ *F* such that *ab* = 0.

We prove by contradiction.

**Step 4:** Suppose *a* ≠ 0 and *b* ≠ 0.

**Step 5:** Since *F* is a field and *a* ≠ 0, there exists *a*⁻¹ ∈ *F* such that *a*⁻¹ · *a* = 1.

**Step 6:** Multiplying both sides of *ab* = 0 by *a*⁻¹ on the left:

```
a⁻¹(ab) = a⁻¹ · 0
```

**Step 7:** By associativity of multiplication:

```
(a⁻¹a)b = 0
```

**Step 8:** Since *a*⁻¹*a* = 1:

```
1 · b = 0
b = 0
```

**Step 9:** This contradicts our assumption that *b* ≠ 0.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, if *ab* = 0, then either *a* = 0 or *b* = 0. Hence, *F* has no zero divisors.

Since *F* is a commutative ring with unity and has no zero divisors, *F* is an integral domain.

**Hence proved.** ∎

## Question 13: Frobenius Endomorphism in Fields of Prime Characteristic
**[6 marks]**

Let *F* be a field of characteristic *p* ≠ 0, where *p* is a prime number.

### Part (a): Prove that (*a* + *b*)ᵖ = *a*ᵖ + *b*ᵖ for all *a*, *b* ∈ *F*

#### Proof

**Step 1:** By the Binomial Theorem:

```
(a + b)ᵖ = Σ(k=0 to p) C(p,k) aᵖ⁻ᵏ bᵏ
```

Expanding:

```
(a + b)ᵖ = C(p,0)aᵖ + C(p,1)aᵖ⁻¹b + C(p,2)aᵖ⁻²b² + ... + C(p,p-1)abᵖ⁻¹ + C(p,p)bᵖ
```

**Step 2:** We know that C(*p*,0) = 1 and C(*p*,*p*) = 1.

For 0 < *k* < *p*:

```
C(p,k) = p! / (k!(p-k)!)
```

**Step 3:** Since *p* is prime and 0 < *k* < *p*, we have:
- *k* < *p* implies *k* does not contain *p* as a factor
- (*p*-*k*) < *p* implies (*p*-*k*) does not contain *p* as a factor
- Therefore, *k*!(*p*-*k*)! does not contain *p* as a factor

**Step 4:** However, the numerator *p*! contains *p* as a factor.

Therefore, *p* divides C(*p*,*k*) for all 0 < *k* < *p*.

**Step 5:** Since *F* has characteristic *p*, we have *p* · 1_F = 0 in *F*.

Therefore, any integer multiple of *p* equals 0 in *F*.

Hence, C(*p*,*k*) = 0 in *F* for all 0 < *k* < *p*.

**Step 6:** Substituting in the binomial expansion:

```
(a + b)ᵖ = 1·aᵖ + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 + 1·bᵖ
(a + b)ᵖ = aᵖ + bᵖ
```

**Hence proved.** ∎

### Part (b): Prove that if *m* = *p*ⁿ (for positive integer *n*), then (*a* + *b*)ᵐ = *a*ᵐ + *b*ᵐ for all *a*, *b* ∈ *F*

#### Proof

We prove this by Mathematical Induction on *n*.

**Base Case:** For *n* = 1, we have *m* = *p*¹ = *p*.

From part (a), we have already proved that (*a* + *b*)ᵖ = *a*ᵖ + *b*ᵖ for all *a*, *b* ∈ *F*.

Therefore, the result is true for *n* = 1.

**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that the result is true for *n* = *k*, i.e., assume:

```
(a + b)^(pᵏ) = a^(pᵏ) + b^(pᵏ)    for all a, b ∈ F
```

**Inductive Step:** We need to prove that the result is true for *n* = *k* + 1, i.e., we need to show:

```
(a + b)^(pᵏ⁺¹) = a^(pᵏ⁺¹) + b^(pᵏ⁺¹)    for all a, b ∈ F
```

**Proof of Inductive Step:**

Consider (*a* + *b*)^(*p*^(*k*+1)) for any *a*, *b* ∈ *F*.

**Step 1:** We can write:

```
pᵏ⁺¹ = pᵏ · p
```

Therefore:

```
(a + b)^(pᵏ⁺¹) = (a + b)^(pᵏ · p) = [(a + b)^(pᵏ)]ᵖ
```

**Step 2:** By the Inductive Hypothesis:

```
(a + b)^(pᵏ) = a^(pᵏ) + b^(pᵏ)
```

**Step 3:** Substituting:

```
[(a + b)^(pᵏ)]ᵖ = [a^(pᵏ) + b^(pᵏ)]ᵖ
```

**Step 4:** Let α = *a*^(*p*^*k*) and β = *b*^(*p*^*k*). Then α, β ∈ *F*.

By part (a):

```
(α + β)ᵖ = αᵖ + βᵖ
```

**Step 5:** Therefore:

```
[a^(pᵏ) + b^(pᵏ)]ᵖ = (a^(pᵏ))ᵖ + (b^(pᵏ))ᵖ
```

**Step 6:** Simplifying:

```
(a^(pᵏ))ᵖ + (b^(pᵏ))ᵖ = a^(pᵏ·p) + b^(pᵏ·p) = a^(pᵏ⁺¹) + b^(pᵏ⁺¹)
```

**Conclusion:** We have shown that:

```
(a + b)^(pᵏ⁺¹) = a^(pᵏ⁺¹) + b^(pᵏ⁺¹)
```

By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the result is true for all positive integers *n*.

Therefore, for *m* = *p*ⁿ, we have (*a* + *b*)ᵐ = *a*ᵐ + *b*ᵐ for all *a*, *b* ∈ *F*.

**Hence proved.** ∎
